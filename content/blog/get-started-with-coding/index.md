So you want to be a developer. And who could blame you? Job demand is high, the barrier to entry is low, and everything you need to get started is free and at your fingertips. But the process can be overwhelming. There's a glut of material out there on the web, and a mountain of choices to be made, so I want to share with you some tips on how to accelerate your journey to dev-land.

## Git you some git

Learn git, and start a Github account. Learn how to push and pull code to and from remote repos.

## Free classes

Also, [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) has some really good self-directed learning paths, a lot of which involve working with other devs on open source projects.

## Pair program

The best way to learn how to code is to live pair with another developer. Having a quick feedback loop is critical for quickly identifying bad habits and also for discovering new concepts. There are some great tools available now that allow devs to pair remotely, like VS Code’s Live Share.

## Learn the tools

I would also recommend installing and learning the basics of VS Code. It’s Microsoft’s free text editor that’s filled with a ton of great features that really help writing JavaScript.

## Attend meetups

And find some dev meetups. Those are a great way to get some more insight on what doing full-stack development is like.

## Give a talk

## Write about what you're learning

## Build things

## Try everything

## Do a boot camp

## Keep at it

Learning to code is not easy. It will stretch your brain in ways you never thought possible. But you can do it. I know you can because I did. It took me four years while working a full-time job, but I was able to make the move from designer to developer.

Honestly, I think the most difficult thing I had to do was figure out what I wanted to do with coding. Being a designer, I naturally gravitated to front-end development, but I wasn't really sure. It took getting my current job at The Container Store to help me realize I'm passionate about accessibility, scalable CSS, and building UI in React.
