I'm a huge fan of continuing education, and one of the ways I binge on information is through podcasts. Here's a list of 11 podcasts that I find not only educational but entertaining as well.

---

- [JS Party](https://changelog.com/jsparty) - From the folks at Changelog, this weekly, hour-ish podcast focusing on JavaScript features a rotating panel and format.
- [Front End Happy Hour](https://frontendhappyhour.com) - A bunch of developers drinking and talking about development. What could go wrong?
- [Developer Tea](https://spec.fm/podcasts/developer-tea) - This podcast is more about the human element of development. I recommend this to developers of all levels, but especially beginners.
- [FSJam Podcast](https://fsjam.org) - Fullstack Jamstack conversations with developers, library maintainers, and industry thought leaders.
- [99% Invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org) - It's not all dev-centric podcasts here. *99% Invisible* peels back the curtain on the design of everyday things. [The flag episode](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/episode-06-99-symbolic/) is a classic.
- [Full Stack Radio](https://fullstackradio.com) - Adam Wathan, creator of (among other things) Tailwind, hosts this podcast with a focus on all the things happening on the front end.
- [Hidden Brain](https://hiddenbrain.org) - This fascinating podcast delves into why we do the things we do and how we can learn from that. It's honestly one of my favs.
- [React Podcast](https://reactpodcast.com) - It's about React. So...
- [ShopTalk Show](https://shoptalkshow.com) - Chris Coyier ([CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com)) and Dave Rupert ([Paravel](https://paravelinc.com)) host this quirky podcast (mostly) about frontend. This podcast was my first developer podcast ever and still one of my favorites.
- [Syntax](https://syntax.fm) - Hosted by Wes Bos and Scott Tolinski, I highly recommend this podcast if you are new to JavaScript. It's chock-full of tips and sick picks.
- [Freakonomics Radio](https://freakonomics.com/archive/) - Again, a podcast about humans for humans. This one has a strong focus on Behavioral Economics, the cross-section of psychology and econ.
