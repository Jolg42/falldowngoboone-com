Frontend development is a field that changes daily, and to stay up-to-date, I need a steady source of new information. One way I do this is through newsletters.

Here's a list of some of the newsletters I subscribe to for all the latest frontend news:

- [React Status](https://react.statuscode.com) - For, you know, React stuff.
- [CSS Layout News](https://csslayout.news) - [Rachel Andrew](https://rachelandrew.co.uk) maintains this newsletter about CSS layout.
