As a follow up to [yesterday's post](), I wanted to share a quick list of online resources that I used to get started in my development career.

- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com)
- [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com)
- [EdX](https://www.edx.org), especially anything having to do with Harvard's [CS50 Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science)
- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org)
- [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com)
- [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com), my absolute favorite resource for deep dive classes
- [Egghead](https://egghead.io)
- [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), the definitive resource for all things web development
- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org), the ultimate FREE boot camp
- [Codepen](https://codepen.io), a great place to experiment with ideas or even build a one-off web page

I'm always looking to expand my resource list, so if you have a favorite you don't see here, please let me know on Twitter.
