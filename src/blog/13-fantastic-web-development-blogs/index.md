There are some amazing web development blogs out there ([Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com), [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com) and [Codrops](http://tympanus.net/codrops/) come to mind), but today I want to pay homage to the humble personal blog. Here are some of my favorite web developer blogs in no particular order:

---

- [Modern CSS](https://moderncss.dev) - Do you still struggle with vertical centering in CSS? This series from Stephanie Eckles is for you.
- [Dan Mall](http://danmall.me) - Dan, the founder of the design collaborative [SuperFriendly](https://superfriendlydesign.systems), is a generous source for all things design systems and client relations.
- [Stuff & Nonsense](https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog) - Andy Clark has been building websites for a while, and he has a thing or two to teach about writing bulletproof CSS. His *Inspired Design Decisions* series is a must-read.
- [Sara Soueidan](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/) - I started following Sara a while back thanks to her amazing contributions to the Codrops blog. She is currently focusing on accessibility, but her SVG filter articles will blow your mind.
- [Sarah Higley](https://sarahmhigley.com) - Sarah is a developer at Microsoft with a passion for accessibility. I learned about her through the fantastic A11y Slack group.
- [Adrian Roselli](https://adrianroselli.com) - I read Adrian's blog to learn how bad I am at accessibility.
- [Ben Meyers](https://benmyers.dev) - I am lucky to know Ben personally through a local Meetup. His blog is filled with tons of great accessibility information. Oh, and make sure you check out his Twitch channel [Some Antics](https://www.twitch.tv/someanticsdev)!
- [Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com) - In addition to posting some great frontend content, Josh has created a truly fun website. I want my blog to be like Josh's when it grows up.
- [Frank Chimero](https://frankchimero.com) - Frank is an accomplished web designer and writer. This site features dense engaging writing that will make you think. My favorite is *[The Web's Grain](https://frankchimero.com/blog/2015/the-webs-grain/)*.
- [Brad Frost](https://bradfrost.com) - He created Atomic Design. He plays bass. If you want to dive more into design systems, you need to follow Brad.
- [Mark Boulton](https://markboulton.co.uk) - Mark's writing has helped me bridge the gap between print and screen design. I highly recommend for developers *and* designers.
- [2ality](https://2ality.com) - Dr. Axel Rauschmayer's blog is a JavaScript developer's dream. He features deep dives into the ES spec and explorations into brand-new JavaScript features.
- [Rachel Andrew](https://rachelandrew.co.uk) - Rachel is an accomplished speaker, writer, and web developer. If you are passionate about CSS, this blog's for you.
