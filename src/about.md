One of my earlier memories is of sitting in the middle of my grandmother's sewing room, surrounded by pieces of her exercise bike I had unceremoniously disassembled with a butterknife. I just had to know how a rubber belt and a series of gears created resistance when my lanky frame would stand on the pedals. I don't think it ran the same after that.

I grew up near Beaumont, Texas, two hours up the Gulf Coast from Houston, where the land is swampy, the air is uniquely perfumed by the endless stream of refineries, and the residences make annual pilgrimages north to escape hurricanes. It was here I met some friends and started a rock band. And just like every other band, we needed a website.

Websites had been a _thing_ for a few years now, and just like my grandmother's exercise bike, I wanted to know how they worked. I learned about View Source and how every website I came across was a new opportunity to learn something new. I bought a student license for Flash and used it to build the most god-awful site you can imagine.

After a while, I started making some extra money building Flash ads for local companies. I learned about PHP, which introduced me to object-oriented programming. Then I started messing around in WordPress. Then I stopped, I guess mainly because I didn't think it was something I could actually pursue.

Fast forward a few years, and a hurricane had convinced me and my high school sweetheart, who was now my wife, to move north the Dallas/Fort Worth area, where I worked as a designer at a small donor development agency. A few years into the job, I started getting interested again in Web development. I started volunteering to code whatever I could for clients (usually emails). I bought subscriptions to online development courses and use my lunch hour as class time. I eventually convinced the agency owners to let me rebuild our company's website.

I learned I loved the constant learning that was required in software development, and decided to jump to a career in development, joining the Technology team at The Container Store.

During my first year at The Container Store, I moved to the Design Tools team and worked on customer-facing organization tools built in React, gave my first talk at a local meetup (it was on ImmutableJS in Redux, if you're curious), and became involved in the JavaScript Special Interest Group (JS SIG).

I've now been at The Container Store for {three} years, and my work has included modernizing our e-commerce application front-end development toolchain, converting our checkout process to a React app, improving the accessibility our website, and facilitating the JavaScript SIG. I also have had the privilege of presenting a few talks as well at our weekly employee-led continuous improvement sessions. I just recently had my first talk proposal picked up by a conference.

I started this website to help other people who may just be starting out in development. Maybe software development is your second, third or fourth career. I want you to know that it's never too late to start. Maybe you don't think you can be a developer without a Computer Science degree. I want you to know that I was a drama major that switched to film school, and most of my coworkers don't have CS degress. Or maybe you just don't want to start over. I want you to know that your life experience is more important than technical experience.

I ultimately want to do work that makes this world better, whether that means making sense of someone's closet or creating a component library that makes it easier to develop accessible UI, and I want to use this space as a way to inspire other developers to do that as well.

Goals and desires

- Started this site as a way to help others trying to get into development
  - I love to learn, and I want to share what I've learned
- I want to talk more and write more
- Being a developer means communicating, yes communicating with a computer, but really communicating to other developers, including your future self; I want to become a better communicator

Encouraging words/takeaway

- If you want to become a developer, you don't need a formal education
  - I'm self-taught
  - My major was in a completely different field
  - Most of the developers I work with don't have CS degrees
  - Look at code, read, build projects (even if you don't finish them), work on open-source software (try writing/correcting documentation at first to get used to using Git)
- It's never too late to start
  - I started after 15 years in a different career
  - Claude Monet didn't start his painting career until his 40s
